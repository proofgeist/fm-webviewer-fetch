# Getting Started

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Purpose

The goal of this package is to make it easy to work with FileMaker data when building a custom webviewer integration. `fm-webviewer-fetch` works **only inside of webviewer** and allows you to interact with your FileMaker solution via local scripts.

For web-based applications where you're looking to interact with the Data API, check out the [fmdapi](https://github.com/proofgeist/fmdapi) package instead.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

```bash
npm install @proofgeist/fm-webviewer-fetch
```
```bash
yarn add @proofgeist/fm-webviewer-fetch
```

then import into your project
